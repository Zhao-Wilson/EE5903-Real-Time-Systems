# EE5903-Real-Time-Systems
In a Real Time System, achieving deadlines of multiple tasks efficiently is the main target of every scheduling algorithm. Therefore, four scheduling algorithms are introduced in this report to solve the problem. The ACO scheduling achieves a balance of exploration and exploitation. The D-R-EDF and EDF-RM scheduling combine both the EDF and RM algorithm to overcome their separate pitfalls but in different ways. The EMUF combines the advantages of fixed and dynamic scheduling and provide dynamically changing priority with flexible scheduling method. All of the above are evaluated in terms of Success Ratio(SR), Average CPU Utilization(ECU).
